## About

NutraGLP is building the platform layer between pharmaceutical GLP-1 drugs and the supplement aisle. The company's patent-pending nanoemulsion technology solves the bioavailability problem that limits most oral nutraceutical formats, ensuring active compounds reach their target metabolic pathways at effective concentrations.

Parent company: NanoAlchemie

## Products

### Slim SHOT
- Daily drinkable liquid nanoemulsion (not an injection)
- Activates endogenous GLP-1 and GIP production
- Inhibits DPP-4 enzyme to extend incretin half-life
- Patent-pending nanoemulsion delivery system
- Price: $145/month, subscription, cancel anytime
- Four GRAS-certified active systems targeting AMPK activation, GPR120 signaling, insulin receptor sensitization, and DPP-4 inhibition
- Status: Pre-order / Waitlist

## Science

The formula targets 13 distinct metabolic pathways across three primary mechanisms:

1. GLP-1 & GIP Activation: AMPK-mediated L-cell stimulation, GPR120 receptor activation triggering incretin secretion, and insulin receptor sensitization supporting glucose-dependent GLP-1 release.

2. DPP-4 Inhibition: Natural DPP-4 inhibitors extend the half-life of endogenously produced GLP-1 by inhibiting enzymatic degradation.

3. Complementary Metabolic Support: Insulin sensitivity enhancement, appetite regulation via gut-brain axis, and AMPK-mediated lipid metabolism.

The nanoemulsion delivery system encapsulates active compounds in lipid-based nanoparticles, increasing surface area, protecting against GI tract degradation, and enhancing cellular uptake.
